(I’ll add more links if I find some, otherwise whatever comes up on a search also works)

- YOLOv7 pre-trained model documentation -> is basically what you’ll want to do, use the pre-trained model on new data to detect objects.

- Also try using labelImg (when done with above) tool to understand YOLO format. 

Tool link: <https://github.com/HumanSignal/labelImg.git>

- Gen\_det folder contains training YOLOv7 on a custom dataset. (for later)

- Copy of OID YOLOv7 train -> is what I’m working on rn. (is a copy)
